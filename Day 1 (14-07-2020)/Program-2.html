            var course="JavaScript";
            var marks=97;
            console.log(name);
            console.log(course);
            console.log(marks);
            {
                let name="Gayathri";
                console.log(name);
            }
            console.log(name);
            const age=18;
            console.log(age);

        <p>var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the
             difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
        </p>
        <h2>var:-</h2>
        <p>var is function scoped.It means like global variable.
           var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope.
           var variables are initialized with undefined.
           var can be declared without being initialized.
        </p>
        <h2>let:-</h2>
        <p>let is block scoped.It means like local variable.
            It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.
            let variables can be updated but not re-declared.
            let can be declared without being initialized
        </p>
        <h2>const:-</h2>
        <p>const is block scoped.
           const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
           const must be initialized during declaration.
        </p>
